Compiling worked directly. Example scenes with pbrt scripts already set up to run the proposed MIS strategy are given in supplementary materials, for instance in supplemental/results/dining-room/scene (run pbrt.exe dining-room.pbrt as usual). It produces results comparable to those advertised. \n\nAdditional scripts to reproduce plots (some rely on Mathematica, others on Matlab ; I did not evaluate them) and to compare image results from different methods are provided.",

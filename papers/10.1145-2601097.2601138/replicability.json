There is no build/run instructions, however I could compile by calling `g++ smallmmlt.cpp` (I used gcc 7.5.0), and ran it as `./a.out`. By default, the renderer runs for 3 minutes (see smallmmlt.cpp:525). It generates a ppm images with a cornell box contained 3 spheres (not in the paper, but similar to Figure 8). The 3d scene is defined in code, and thus adapting to other contexts might require some development effort.",

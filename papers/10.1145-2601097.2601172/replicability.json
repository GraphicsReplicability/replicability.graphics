While the paper sells speed over concurrent approaches, the reference monothreaded CPU implementation does not allow to reproduce the timings given in the paper. The implementation also does not reconstruct the surfaces (only the point projection is implemented) so the surfaces shown in the paper cannot be reproduced from this implementation. The implementation is also missing the normal projection step.",

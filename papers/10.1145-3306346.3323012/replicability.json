Make sure to follow the instructions AFTER having cloned the Progressive Embedding project:\n  git clone https://github.com/hankstag/progressive_embedding.git\n  cd progressive_embedding\nthen the then libigl cloning instructions.\nThe CMakeLists has several issues. First, a source file is missing (test_local_smoothing.cpp), so you would need to comment out the line 91 and 101 of the CMakeLists.txt. Then, there is a tbb link issue: line 93\n   target_link_libraries(progressive_embedding igl::core igl::triangle igl::opengl_glfw igl::cgal igl::opengl_glfw_imgui tab_static)\nmust be replaced by\n   target_link_libraries(progressive_embedding igl::core igl::triangle igl::opengl_glfw igl::cgal igl::opengl_glfw_imgui tbb_static)\n\n After that, everything builds perfectly. There is no precise description nor documentation of the executables but using the provided data and the given examples, I was able to reproduce some results that seem to match with the paper ones.",

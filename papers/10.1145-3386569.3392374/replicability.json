The codes build and run perfectly outputing some CSV 2D map that must be converted to an image to 'visualize' the output. Per se, the provided code can only partially reproduce some paper results but interested readers should be able to quickly reimplement the core contributions of the paper (see Misc. comments). Some applications mentionned in the paper may require additional efforts (VF, Helmholtz Decomposition and Shape Deformation).",
        "Misc. comments": "In the project page, the authors also provide links to many shadertoy scripts that reproduce some paper results (scripts not from the authors)."

Also, it has to be compiled with the eigen provided with igl. Compiling it with the latest Eigen produces an error \"THE_EVAL_EVALTO_FUNCTION_SHOULD_NEVER_BE_CALLED_FOR_DENSE_OBJECTS\" in Eigen.\nA single example (armadillo) is provided for the demo, but I believe it should reproduce the examples shown in the paper as the result is reasonable.",

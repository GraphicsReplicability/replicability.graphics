Two executables are provided:\n - FIST: compute scale, translation and rotation between two random point-clouds (so I cannot set a replicability score of 5). Even if it runs, it is impossible to know if the computed transformation is good or not.\n - colorTransfer: I had to fix a minor bug to make it run: the input images are not located at the place the software attempts to load them. I fixed it by adding a shortcut in my filesystem:\n ~/git/spot$ ln -s Datasets/Images/ data/.\n Results are totally fine for this program.",

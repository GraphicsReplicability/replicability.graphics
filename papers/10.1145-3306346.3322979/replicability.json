No issue to build the project.\nOn Mac, there is an issue when building geometry-central:\n\n make[2]: *** No rule to make target `../deps/geometry-central/deps/-lm', needed by `bin/int_tri'.  Stop.\n\n Note that this bug has been fixed in the geometry-central master (not the same version as the git submodule in the deps folder).\nTo fix the issue, just upgrade the submodule to the master:\n\n cd deps/geometry-central/ ; git checkout master ; cd ../../build ; make\n\nBeside this issue, most paper results can be reproduced from the code.",

You need to add '/arch:AVX' to CXXFLAGS, and change MSVC_VERSION    = '10.0' to MSVC_VERSION    = '14.1'  (I tried 15.0 since I have VS2017, but VS complained).\n\nIn mitsuba/cor/util.h, you need to add #include <intrin.h>\nIn Mitsuba 0.5.0\\dependencies\\include\\boost\\config\\compiler\\visualc.hpp, you may comment-out lined 44  #if _MSC_VER < 1300 and the matching #end line 54, and perhaps manually set #define BOOST_COMPILER_VERSION evc15 instead of the error message lines 283--287.\n\nIn LibImportance/shared/Config.h, I have issues with \n    const Float NAN = std::numeric_limits<Float>::signaling_NaN();\n    const Float INFINITY = std::numeric_limits<Float>::infinity();\nline 109.\nAdding #undef NAN and #undef INFINITY did not solve the problem, and commenting out these two lines either.\n\nIn LibImportance/shared/Sse.h, the compiler complains about undefined SSE functions, or similarly in avx_mathfun.h, it complains about the undefined __m256 type. Adding #include <intrin.h> did not help (anyway, there is already #include <immintrin.h> ), and passing the /arch:AVX to the compiler in the config-win64-msvc2010.py did not help either (usually, having arch:AVX and intrin.h is sufficient to have __m256 defined ; however, while this works with VisualStudio alone, the SConsScript may not work).\n\nUltimately, I could not fix these issues and run the code.\n\n-- Alternate test on Linux \nCompilation did not succeed on Linux.\n fatal error: xutility: No such file or directory   27 | #include <xutility>, after commenting this line, I got to the error:\nfastonebigheader.h:60:10: fatal error: PrecompiledLibs/Embree/common/simd/smmintrin_emu.h: No such file or directory\n   60 | #include \"PrecompiledLibs/Embree/common/simd/smmintrin_emu.h\"\n\nwhich I was not able to solve.",
